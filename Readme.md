# MySQL Tools

##### Command-line shell scripts for managing MySQL databases on Laravel-based web applications.

## Installation

#### Installing via Composer

Add the following to our `composer.json` file:

```
"require": {
    "impactwave/mysql-tools": "dev-master"
},
```

### Configuration steps

If you haven't done it before, add `vendor/bin` to your path, so that you may execute package executables from your project's root folder.


#####Example:

Add this to your shell environment (ex: at `~/.profile` or `~/.bash_profile`):

	export PATH=$PATH:./vendor/bin

## Usage

On the terminal, change to your project's root directory (where your `composer.json` lies) and just type the desired command name.

You can use autocompletion by pressing Tab.
